# API--AutomationTestingFramework
This is my project for the itFactory Automation Testing course. I implemented a framework for API automation testing.

The endpoint used for this project is available on an [automation exercise website](https://automationexercise.com/api_list) that provides a various list of API endpoints for practice purposes. The endpoint returns a list of various clothing products with different characteristics such as the brand of the item, what usertype is it suitable for and the price. The API endpoint is used for website https://automationexercise.com/products that plays the front store role for selling the products.

The structure of the project consists of 2 python folders: one for testing the endpoint for the list of all products and the second one for testing the endpoint for the list of all brands. Each folder has 2 file: one with the API request methods and the other with the tests performed. There is a total of 20 tests performed. Each test verifies the API response in Json format for different search parameters.
