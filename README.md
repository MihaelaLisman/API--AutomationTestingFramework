# API--AutomationTestingFramework
This is my project for the itFactory Automation Testing course. I implemented a framework for API automation testing.

The endpoint used for this project is available on an [automation exercise website](https://automationexercise.com/api_list) that provides a various list of API endpoints for practice purposes. The endpoint returns a list of various clothing products with different characteristics such as the brand of the item, what usertype is it suitable for and the price.
